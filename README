Breadth-first search written in X10

Compile:
Edit the Makefile in the 'code' folder. Change CCDIR to the directory containing the x10c++ or/and x10c (java-backend)compiler. 
 -> make cpp : compile using the c++ backend
 -> make java: compile using the java backend

Use with c++ backend
Execute bfs_start. Type bfs_start --help for more information

Use with java backend
Execute 'x10' from the X10 bin-folder with 'Bfs' as first argument 




Which algorithms are implemented?
-----------------------------------------------
The following algorithm are supported ( -alg <alg>).
Let n be the number of vertices and m be the total number of edges

    serial_matrix   The graph will be represented by a twodimensional array
                    of boolean values i.e. you need memory for n * n boolean values.
                    The bfs-algorithm is executed only in place 0 in a serial
                    manner using two lists, one for the active vertices and one
                    for the newly found neighbors (which are active by themselfs
                    in the next iteration). Be carefull, very slow for big graphs!

    serial_list     The graph will be represented as an array of lists. The array
                    has the length n. The list of all adjacent vertices of vertex i
                    is stored at the i-th place in the array. The algorithm is the
                    same as described 'serial_matrix'

    serial_sparse  The graph will be represented as two arrays of the sizes n+1 and m.
                   Let the array of the size n+1 be 'index' and the other one 'values'.
                   The index array points to the beginning of the secion of
                   the values array, where the corresponding edges are stored. All
                   adjacent vertices of the vertix i are stores from values[index[i]]
                   to values[index[i+1] -1] (inclusive). The algorithm used is the 
                   same as in 'serial_matrix'

    1d_matrix
